        <p>
            We are a team of Computer Science students at Boston University. We created Stuvi (Student Village) as a student solution service,
            ranging from textbook deliveries, to managing academic life. To kick-off our launch, we're offering a new method to buy and sell
            your textbooks. Simply search for your book, describe its condition, and start making money.
